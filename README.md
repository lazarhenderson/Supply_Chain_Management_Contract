# Supply Chain Management - README WIP

## Problems with contract

1. Can only fetch products 1 at a time

   Solutions:

   - Use script to fetch products 1 by 1
   - Can put products into an array for easier fetching
   - Divide products by manufacturer's name which is mapped to an array of structs

2. Product prices aren't taken into account

## Functionality to be added:

1. If products are expired at creation
